									<p>Global Product Development (GPD) is a joint-university, project-based course that practices interdisciplinary teaching approach among three institutions in Seoul, Beijing and Hong Kong. I was in a multicultural and multidisciplinary student teams to seek for and define a global user-centered design problem, iterate through design solutions, and build the final functional prototype. <br />
									In the course, our team wanted to create a solution to make people's morning routines better. After our preliminary and secondary market research, we found that a lot of people are finding difficulties waking up in the morning, and they think their current morning routines are only having negative effects to the rest of their days. Targeting mainly on students and office workers, we came up with a IoT container that provides an all-in-one solution for a person's morning routine - a toothbrush holder, toothbrush santisizer, an bathroom organizer, a phone holder connected with an alarm app. <br />

								<h3>1. Market research</h3>
								<p>Before we had an idea on what we wanted to build, we conducted two rounds of market research to identify target customers, market size and global aspects of the potential market segments we are facing. We also wanted to make clear the customers’ pain points and their translation into the customer requirements. Moreover, since we are building a global product, we would like to consider it in different countries’ contexts. <br />
								From the primary research conducted, we identified common problem scenarios - messy bathrooms, over-abundance of female and male bathroom products, and general tiredness in the morning. We conducted both desktop research, questionnaires and interviews to get factual data and examine our current assumptions. </p>
								<h3><span class="image left"><img src="images/gpd/survey_result.png" alt="" /></span>Waking up is the hardest amongst all morning routines</h3>

								<p>	we were able to find the specific reasons and pain-points surrounding these observations. It suggests that the psychological origin of this problem to be rooted in human aversion to decision making and general lack of self-discipline. When asked about why they are unable to get up, have breakfast, or organize their bathrooms people cite the abundance of choices and lack of motivation or it just being “hard”. Tasks that require conscious effort and decision making are further dulled by the lack of energy from just getting up. Alarms, sleep-reminders, and coffee are not effective solutions for this market segment. </p>
