								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>Chatbots are virtual online agents that simulate conversations or interactions with real people. Although they have made great hit in the market, some more specific applications of the chatbots are yet to be explored.</p>
								<p>E-learning is the new booming industry that supplements human desire of lifelong learning, and MOOC(Massive Open Online Course) is one of the latest tools to transform education in a significant way.</p>
								<p>In the Final Year Project, we introduced chatbots into e-learning environments to add up interactivity in e-learning platforms. To do this, we built an Chatbot system that handles user's questions, which was integrated it into Open edX, the online MOOC platform. The system enables both speech and text input, and passes the query through the question-and-answer pipeline and eventually returns the best answer if enough confidence is calculated. </p>
								<p>The experiment result showed the chatbot was confident to answer 35% of the questions and 70% of the answers were relevant and useful. Those unresolved questions were then forwarded it to a human teaching assistant of the course to address. A chat room feature was also enabled for the student to communicate with other fellow classmates and discusses questions.</p>
								<p>Our Final Year Project was listed as one of the<a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/ug/fyp/bestfyp/"> Best FYPs in year 2018-2019</a>. It also entered the IEEE (Hong Kong) Computational Intelligence Chapter Final Year Project Competition 2018-2019 as the second runner-up. </p>
